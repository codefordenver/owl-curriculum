        [:p "We originally developed this platform to meet the specific needs of a small group of new technology teachers working in Denver Public Schools (DPS) via OpenWorld Learning (OWL), a local non-profit. We set out to create a platform that addressed their particular challenges in terms of curriculum content creation, delivery, accessibility, and keeping middle school   students engaged (no small feat)."]

         " from computer scientists/educators such as Alan Kay, Simon Papert (constructivism), Kathy Sierra, Linda Liukas, Ted Nelson, Elon Musk, Tim Bell, etc… the list goes on. "]
